For the rap music, A$AP MOB, and coding lovers:

Just like my Rick and Morty game, these are projects I created in high school but want to come back to.
This one is an extremely basic program which actually did work just as I wanted it to but the audios stopped working a few months back.

I'm revisiting it now to fix the audio issues.

You can even experience it here: https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/-GoyEP2NDUvd4QcF7QKfgRAKKXkysOW8_rBQcffdM2I


4/2 Update:
I have decided to restart this program from scratch, it will be good JS practice again
